# 🤖 Tajan — Intelligent User Intent Recognition Assistant


## 🧠 Project Overview

**Tajan** is an intelligent intent-recognition system built on deep bidirectional neural networks. Given a sentence or question from the user, it identifies the intended purpose from among **419 distinct topics** and returns a relevant, accurate, and efficient response.

The project was designed and implemented to provide a **fast, accurate, customizable** solution that runs **fully offline** — making it suitable for a wide range of industries such as customer support, education, healthcare, e-commerce, and municipal services.
